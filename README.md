## Overview
This Bash script allows users to search the web using a preferred search engine directly from the terminal. Users can choose between Google and DuckDuckGo, and the script remembers your choice for subsequent searches. Additionally, you can change the search engine or exit the program at any time.
This project was made for fun and to explore what I can do personally with bash scripting.

## Requirements
- A Unix-based operating system with Bash.
- Firefox browser installed (used to open search results).

## Known Issues
- Queries with special characters may require additional handling.

## Future Improvements
- [x] Add support for more browsers (e.g., Chrome, Edge).
- [ ] Implement error handling for invalid URLs.
- [x] Provide more search engine options (e.g., Bing, Yahoo).
- [ ] Enhance query parsing to handle special characters better.
